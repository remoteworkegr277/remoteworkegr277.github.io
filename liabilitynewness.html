            It is fascinating to see Zoom’s success despite all these controversies. Dr. Yoo, how did this happen? How was zoom able to become so popular despite these controversies? That’s a great question. And I think that in some ways, we can frame this as a question of how Zoom was able to overcome the problem known as the liability of newness. For many, the introduction of widespread use of virtual communication technologies was a very new thing. Let’s take a trip back to the time at which there was a lot of uncertainty. People weren’t sure they were going to be fully remote or fully virtual. What technologies could be used? What would be the protocol for education? Amidst this time of uncertainty, consider teachers in classrooms, professors in lecture halls, businesspeople in glass buildings all of a sudden being introduced to this somewhat foreign technology that proposes to replace in-person interaction. How would this new, foreign technology have had to be marketed such that it could help tip the scales toward transitioning to fully-remote learning on that technological platform? Here, I think we can look to history to see how innovators of the past overcame such potential hurdles. In 2001, Andrew Hargadon from the University of California and Yellowlees Douglas from the University of Florida published a paper detailing the intentional design and marketing decisions that Edison made to overcome the liability of newness in the system of electric light. At the time, gas lighting was the lighting to use. Consumers were used to gas lighting - the various methods of gas metering and paying for gas, and gas companies were used to the profits that came with the business. To establish the legitimacy of the system of electric light, Edison encapsulated the system of electric light within the infrastructure vocabulary of the system of gas lighting. For example, Edison’s electric lights came with wall designs that were similar to those of gas lighting. The wiring of electric lights were built around gas pipes. And power for electric lighting was produced in central stations, similar to gas lighting. Edison even went so far as to use the same metering technology. Why did Edison do this? By grounding the principles of electric lighting in the norms of the day, he could ease consumers into accepting the new technology. Now bringing us back to today, we can see how zoom was able to establish its legitimacy. In-person education is the established protocol for teaching and learning. To establish its legitimacy, we see how Zoom adopted vocabulary and structure from in-person learning. For example, Zoom adopted a whiteboard function that allows teachers and students to draw figures and write text, similar to classroom whiteboards. Zoom also adopted a “raise hand” function that shows a virtual hand raised when a student wants to ask a question. This doesn’t mean students actually raise their physical hand, but by borrowing the vocabulary of what students and teachers are familiar with, Zoom eases itself into market domination by providing a degree of comfort to its potential consumers. The list goes on. From breakout rooms that provide a structure similar to students physically “breaking out” into smaller groups as with in-person learning, to the waiting room function that mirrors the structure of in-person appointments that have a physical waiting room with a line of people, zoom has made many intentional design decisions that involve the function and naming of various features that have allowed it to flourish as an alternative to in-person communication.
