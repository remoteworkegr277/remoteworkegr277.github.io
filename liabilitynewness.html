       <b>Liability of Newness</b><br><br>
        
        In claiming the title of victor in the videoconferencing market, Zoom had to overcome the hurdle known as "liability of newness," whereby new “new firms are more likely to fail than old ones” [6]. In the case of videoconferencing technologies, the old firm was a psychological and social one: the culture of in-person interaction and the artifacts that come with such interaction (physical whiteboards, meeting rooms). Hence, the new firm (videoconferencing) had to operate, not only at the technical level, but also at the level of <i>social</i> landscapes in order to replace that which was <i>social</i> in nature.<br><br>

        For historical context, we can look to how Edison made intentional design and marketing decisions in his system of electric lights to overcome the established system of gas lighting in the late 1800s [7]. <br><br>

        <b>Imitation: How Zoom, like Edison, used social familiarities to guide system design</b><br><br>

        The issue of overcoming liability of newness is at the interface between social familiarities and technical design, because ultimately, one needs to consider, not only the technical features of the innovation, but also how users will interact with those features. The degree of comfort with which users can begin to interact with those features, given their past experiences, determines how well an innovation overcomes this liability and, hence, is determined by how closely the innovation is modeled after social familiarities (literally "past experiences").<br><br>

        In imitating those social familiarities, Edison sought to “not to make a large light or a blinding light but a small light having the mildness of gas” [7]. He buried his electric lines underground and covered his lights with lampshades, as with gas lighting [7]. Edison even went so far as to use the same metering technology [7].<br><br>
        
        We can see how Zoom was able to establish its legitimacy. In-person education is the established protocol for teaching and learning. To establish its legitimacy, we see how Zoom adopted vocabulary and structure from in-person learning. For example, Zoom adopted a whiteboard function that allows teachers and students to draw figures and write text, similar to classroom whiteboards. Zoom also adopted a “raise hand” function that shows a virtual hand raised when a student wants to ask a question. This doesn’t mean students actually raise their physical hand, but by borrowing the vocabulary of what students and teachers are familiar with, Zoom eases itself into market domination by providing a degree of comfort to its potential consumers. The list goes on. From breakout rooms that provide a structure similar to students physically “breaking out” into smaller groups as with in-person learning, to the waiting room function that mirrors the structure of in-person appointments that have a physical waiting room with a line of people, zoom has made many intentional design decisions that involve the function and naming of various features that have allowed it to flourish as an alternative to in-person communication.



Robust Design: Imitation
     

    With regards to functionality, Edison, in his quest to imitate aspects of gas lighting in his system of electric light, went so far as to “not to make a large light or a blinding light but a small light having the mildness of gas” and he pushed to produce electricity centrally in the manner of gas lighting central stations [1]. With regards to interface, Edison’s electric lines were buried underground and his lights were covered with lampshades, as with gas lighting. In function and interface, Zoom made comparable moves to imitate in-person communication’s various functions, as well as the presentation of those functions (the interface).
For example, Zoom includes the ability to bring to the attention of the host that you have a question or comment (named “Raise Hand”) [3], which mirrors the real act of raising one’s hand in class for the purpose of drawing attention.
    Zoom also features a collaborative board on which participants can draw and write together (named “Whiteboard”) [3], which mirrors the physical whiteboard in classrooms on which teachers and students brainstorm together.
    Similar to how there are different rooms for different kinds of meetings in physical settings, Zoom features separate spaces for a variety of conversations (named “Personal Meeting Room,” “Waiting Room,” “Breakout Room”) [3], which again borrow from the vocabulary of in-person waiting rooms and the act of “breaking out” into smaller groups to work on small group projects.
    Zoom also features a “Zoom Events Conference” event type that mirrors large in-person conferences (like those for academic publications) and facilitates “multi-track and multi-day events” [4]. These virtual events feature a “lobby” and “booths” [5], though there is no physical lobby or booth; by borrowing the vocabulary of established conference norms, Zoom is able to smoothly introduce new innovations.
    As a final point to imitation, Zoom’s logo is a bulky video camera [3], which is reminiscent of the physical device that one might bring to record a physical, live talk. Though most Zoom users would not be using these kinds of bulky video cameras to record themselves, by grounding the technology interface (logo) in an established visual, Zoom further constructs its legitimacy.

Robust Design: Leeway
    The second element to robust design is leeway to evolve in the future [1]. Edison’s vision was to use electricity to ultimately power many appliances (such as sewing machines), so he played this idea into the marketing of his system. “He even incorporated his Electric Light Company with the broad purpose of developing and marketing any invention” [1]. Similarly, at the beginning of the transition from in-person meetings to videoconferencing, Zoom’s CEO Eric Yuan wrote in a blog about Zoom’s commitment to “agile customer service” and “the flexibility… of the Zoom platform” [6]. Similar to Edison, Yuan builds the particular leeway of robust design into the marketing element of the technology so as to allow customers to expect the continuous development of new features in the evolution of Zoom.

Conclusion
    In the case of Zoom, we see how a disruptive innovation replaced the established norm of in-person communication and provided a comfortable and intuitive alternative through the process of imitating characteristics of functionality and interface from in-person communication and creating leeway by marketing the long-term goals of the technology.


            It is fascinating to see Zoom’s success despite all these controversies. How was Zoom able to become so popular despite these controversies? We can frame this as a question of how Zoom was able to overcome the problem known as the liability of newness. For many, the introduction of widespread use of virtual communication technologies was a very new thing. Let’s take a trip back to the time at which there was a lot of uncertainty. People weren’t sure they were going to be fully remote or fully virtual. What technologies could be used? What would be the protocol for education? Amidst this time of uncertainty, consider teachers in classrooms, professors in lecture halls, businesspeople in glass buildings all of a sudden being introduced to this somewhat foreign technology that proposes to replace in-person interaction. How would this new, foreign technology have had to be marketed such that it could help tip the scales toward transitioning to fully-remote learning on that technological platform? Here, I think we can look to history to see how innovators of the past overcame such potential hurdles. In 2001, Andrew Hargadon from the University of California and Yellowlees Douglas from the University of Florida published a paper detailing the intentional design and marketing decisions that Edison made to overcome the liability of newness in the system of electric light. At the time, gas lighting was the lighting to use. Consumers were used to gas lighting - the various methods of gas metering and paying for gas, and gas companies were used to the profits that came with the business. To establish the legitimacy of the system of electric light, Edison encapsulated the system of electric light within the infrastructure vocabulary of the system of gas lighting. For example, Edison’s electric lights came with wall designs that were similar to those of gas lighting. The wiring of electric lights were built around gas pipes. And power for electric lighting was produced in central stations, similar to gas lighting. Edison even went so far as to use the same metering technology. Why did Edison do this? By grounding the principles of electric lighting in the norms of the day, he could ease consumers into accepting the new technology. Now bringing us back to today, we can see how zoom was able to establish its legitimacy. In-person education is the established protocol for teaching and learning. To establish its legitimacy, we see how Zoom adopted vocabulary and structure from in-person learning. For example, Zoom adopted a whiteboard function that allows teachers and students to draw figures and write text, similar to classroom whiteboards. Zoom also adopted a “raise hand” function that shows a virtual hand raised when a student wants to ask a question. This doesn’t mean students actually raise their physical hand, but by borrowing the vocabulary of what students and teachers are familiar with, Zoom eases itself into market domination by providing a degree of comfort to its potential consumers. The list goes on. From breakout rooms that provide a structure similar to students physically “breaking out” into smaller groups as with in-person learning, to the waiting room function that mirrors the structure of in-person appointments that have a physical waiting room with a line of people, zoom has made many intentional design decisions that involve the function and naming of various features that have allowed it to flourish as an alternative to in-person communication.
